== *Creating* a new UML project==
To create a new project, clic the _New UML project_ button https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/newUML1.png on the Standard toolbar, or choose _New project_ from the _File_ menu or use _Ctrl + N_ shortcuts. If you use _New project_ choice you can beside create a _New PDDL project_ ((_Ctrl + P_ shortcuts). 

== Opening a Document == 

To open a documen click the _Open project_ button on the Standard toolbar: https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/openDoc.png , or choose _Open project from the _File_ menu or simply use _Ctrl + O_ shortcuts.

You can open recent project clicking the _Open recent project_ choice from _File_ menu. 

== Saving a Document ==
To save a document click the _Save project_ button on the Standard toolbar https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/save1.png, or choose _Save project_ from the _File_ menu.  When you save the project for the first time, *itSIMPE4.0* displays the _Save As dialog box so that you can choice the saving path.

== Modeling process ==

Modeling can be described as graphically representing a  software system. The resulting model can be used to emphasize a certain aspect of the system being represented, and to record, document and communicate its detail. A study of such a model can enable insight or understanding of the planning system.  *itSIMPLE4.0*'s modeling platform is based on the _Unified Modeling Language_ (*UML*), a standard that defines rules and notations for specifying business and software systems. 

*itSIMPLE4.0* proposes a special use of *UML* in a planning approach (named *UML.P*) which we believe can contribute to the knowledge acquisition process (from different viewpoints) as well as to the domain model visualization and verification.

The environment was designed to incorporate a toolset (representation languages and theories) capable of dealing with requirements and knowledge engineering.

Some of the *UML diagrams* can be directly applied for planning domains such as _use case diagram_, _class diagram_, and _state chart diagram_ for each project [see in left panel Manage project *Newproject1* diagrams].
