= Modeling Object Diagram =
Based on the objects defined in _Class Diagram_ you will begin to define the _Planning Problem_. This objects are instances of this classes.

The first step is select for this project from _itSIMPLE_main screen, the _Planning Domain_ option in the _Projects Manager_ panel:

==_The Object Respository_==

The _Object Respository_ is where we will have instances of classes (_Objects_), so that the goal is to store all objects which will be used in the _Initial_ and _Goal_ states represented by _Objects Diagram_.

For create a new diagram you must do right click and select _Open Diagram_ option and will appear in the _Diagram View_ a tool bar with all components for modeling process:

An object (https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/object.png) is  a particular instance of a Class.

For create an _Object_ with _itSIMPLE_ tool, you must click on the _Object_ icon (https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/object.png) at the toolbar and choose on the _Diagram View Area_ where you want put it. After that you can define in _Object Properties_ panel, a _name_, select a class for which a _object_ is instance, and some brief description.

You can assigned values to Object's attributes in the _Object Properties_:

When you need to create several objects of the same type, you can use _Multi Object_ (https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/multiobjects.png) and will be appear a new panel for it:

Now you can choose the right class, a quantity of objects and a list of number for each objects. Beside you can define _object association_ between objects (https://my-project-probando.googlecode.com/svn/association.png).

So you can open the initial(goal) State written as Snapshot- init(goal). In the Additional properties panel displays all objects for adding in the initial or goal states.

Now you can define a very essencial part of _Planning Problem_ through the initial and goal state with all objects involved in the real problem.
